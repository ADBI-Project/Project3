##Predicting Bitcoin Price Variations using Bayesian Regression
In this project, you will be tasked with predicting the price variations of bitcoin, a virtual cryptographic currency. These predictions could be used as the foundation of a bitcoin trading strategy. To make these predictions, you will have to familiarize yourself with a machine learning technique, Bayesian Regression, and implement this technique in Python.
